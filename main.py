General purpose mouse click accuracy improvement for AI vision models

Given a goal, propsed mouse click, screenshot, and number of iterations
(1) Crop around the proposed click location
(2) Ask the model where to click
(3) Translate the zoomed click location to the unzoomed click location
(3) Repeat for x number of iterations
(6) Return the final unzoomed click location
